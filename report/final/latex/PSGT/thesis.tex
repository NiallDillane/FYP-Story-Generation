\chapter*{Appendix B} \label{appendix:story}
\section*{AI Generated Story} 

\textbf{Once upon a time,} I even tried to leave the room, but nobody could help me. I knew that those buildings were haunted, and I knew that these people were worse than I had ever seen them. The only thing that kept me from going back was that I was haunted.

That evening, I knocked on the door and asked if anyone else wanted to come in. I told them I was a demon, and that I knew the answer to that. They all agreed, but their collective eyes were fixed on me.

This is what happened next.

I could hear the voices coming from downstairs. My bedroom. I could hear the sound of my heart beating. The sound of my mom crying. 

I called the police, but they couldn't do much. They told me they'd find out why I was there, but that it was too late.

I went back home and told them that I'd had a nightmare, but that I was going to go back down to the basement and try and sleep. My mom said that she didn't believe me, but I guess she wasn't too crazy. She said that if I didn't go back down to the basement, she'd know. She said that it was my fault. 

I didn't sleep. I didn't dream.

I couldn't forget. I didn't. I don't remember. There was the time that my mom found me in my room. I sat at the foot of my bed and tried to wake up. She told me that I had to go back to bed. She asked me to the stairs. I woke me to see how much that I was not happy, but she was wrong, that she didn't want to go back.

\chapter*{Appendix C} \label{appendix:story2}
\section*{AI Generated Story 2 - Original} 

Once upon a time, a sweet girl – no more than six or seven – had woken up and seen my mother’s hand on my shoulder. She laughed and nodded. It was the most comforting thing I’d ever heard her say, and I had never seen her so happy. I had to remember it too.

The next day, the sun rose. The tree that stood in the middle of the night had fallen.

I walked home, scared, and told my mom about the strange encounter. She said it was good, but I could tell she wasn’t thinking well. She knew something was wrong, and she could see I had a heart attack.

I was three weeks into my therapy. When I started to feel better, I fell asleep on the bed beside my bed, and then woke up again. I woke up again, this time at 2:00 in the morning. I tried to call the police, but my phone rang. My mother tried to explain what happened, but my voice was hoarse and I couldn’t even finish my sentence. I went to the station and told them everything that had happened, but they didn’t believe me. I told them everything that had happened, but they didn’t believe me. I wasn’t stupid, but they had to find out about it.

I started to make up stories. I would ask people to try to explain. They would tell me to explain that the police were wrong. I would try to explain that I was a murderer. I would try to explain to explain it to explain the police wasn't...

They knew nothing I didn’t believe me, but that’ve seen the bruises and bruises and cuts. But the police would tell me because they told me how I was hurt. They wouldn’t believe me. They told me that I was more than I was hurting. That I was guilty. I had to tell them. How I couldn’d hurt. And they were so scared of the real me. Every single person that hurt me. I was hurt.

I finally convinced my mom that I was so worried of the world; I didn’t believe them, but the police. But they gave me no excuses. How they couldn’t tell me that I had been all those years ago, but they knew I was right. I wanted them to tell them. They believed me. How they wouldn’t, because they tried so much to explain that I was wrong. They told me the truth; how they were all wrong and that if they took me away, I was the one who did it. I was special.

As I’ve repeated it, every single person on earth. How they hurt. How they worked to take me and how they went wrong. I had done it. How I was beautiful and I could do it with others, the way I am. I felt lonely; how we always were. I couldn’t let go, the way it hurt. I didn’t suffer so much. I thought I would be free. That’d never be alone.

“He won. He tried to kill me, man. And now he’s laughing. It’s in my mind. Is now mad. All I can think about, now. Who I am. Don’t you remember. Everyone loves you
