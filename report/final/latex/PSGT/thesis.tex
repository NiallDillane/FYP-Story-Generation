\textbf{Once upon a time,} I even tried to leave the room, but nobody could help me. I knew that those buildings were haunted, and I knew that these people were worse than I had ever seen them. The only thing that kept me from going back was that I was haunted.

That evening, I knocked on the door and asked if anyone else wanted to come in. I told them I was a demon, and that I knew the answer to that. They all agreed, but their collective eyes were fixed on me.

This is what happened next.

I could hear the voices coming from downstairs. My bedroom. I could hear the sound of my heart beating. The sound of my mom crying. 

I called the police, but they couldn't do much. They told me they'd find out why I was there, but that it was too late.

I went back home and told them that I'd had a nightmare, but that I was going to go back down to the basement and try and sleep. My mom said that she didn't believe me, but I guess she wasn't too crazy. She said that if I didn't go back down to the basement, she'd know. She said that it was my fault. 

I didn't sleep. I didn't dream.

I couldn't forget. I didn't. I don't remember. There was the time that my mom found me in my room. I sat at the foot of my bed and tried to wake up. She told me that I had to go back to bed. She asked me to the stairs. I woke me to see how much that I was not happy, but she was wrong, that she didn't want to go back.
