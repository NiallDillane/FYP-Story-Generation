Procedural content generation (PCG) – the process of generating data algorithmically – is a technique that has applications across a variety of domains. In the research outlined in this report, focus is directed to the use of PCG as a means to generate stories. The challenge is manifold, with research into: the structure and language of stories, addressing such questions as “What are the elements of a good story?”; procedural generation technologies, from historical to state-of-the-art; and methods to codify the elements of stories in such a way that they can be used by a procedural generation technique. Finally, an application is presented, created to allow the creativity of an end-user work in tandem with the power of an automated system to produce stories.
