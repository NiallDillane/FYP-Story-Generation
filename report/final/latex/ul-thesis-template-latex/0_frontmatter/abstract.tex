Procedural content generation (PCG) – the process of generating data algorithmically – is a technique that has applications across a variety of domains. In the research outlined in this report, focus is directed to the use of PCG as a means to generate novel-like stories. The challenge is twofold: research into procedural generation methods, as well as the structure and language of stories, addressing questions such as: “What are the elements of a good story?”. Finally, methods to codify these elements must be investigated, in such a way that they can be used by a procedural generation technique, effectively combining the two disciplines.
