First and foremost I would like to thank James Patten; both for his inspiration of the topic researched, and the constant helpful advice and motivation throughout. This extends to all of the lecturers and teaching assistants I have interacted with over the years, each of whom contributed to where I am today.

The wide breadth of open source code, lectures and tutorials available online were also essential in allowing me to carry out this project, as it was all new ground compared to schoolwork that came before it.
